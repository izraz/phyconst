# Physical Constants

This is a simple python file with physical constants defined as phython
variables.

Variable names are descriptive in CamelCase and include physical units, e.g.
	BoltzmannConstant_JpK
for the Botzmann constant in units J/K ("p" is for "per").

## Usage
	from phyconst import BoltzmannConstant_JpK as k
